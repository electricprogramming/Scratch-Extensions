# How to use these extensions.
These extensions are designed to function in *native Scratch*, which means you can do things like run JavaScript in your Scratch projects.  
To use these, you have to either create a bookmarklet with a `javascript:` URL and click it or just run the code in the browser console. Either way, it needs to be run before the project starts.
In the editor, it is slightly different. The easiest way is to find the project page, load the extension, and then click on `see inside`.
